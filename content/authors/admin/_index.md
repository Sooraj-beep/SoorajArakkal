Hey there! I am Soooraj, a student of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. I expect to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Winter 2022. My interests include AI/ML, Software Development, Robotics and Computer Architecture.

Additionally, I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for the University of Alberta for the formal systems and logic course and also have experience working in the IT sector as a technical writer.
