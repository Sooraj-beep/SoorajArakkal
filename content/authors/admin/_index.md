Hey there! I am Sooraj, a student majoring in Computing Science at the University of Alberta. I expect to graduate with a Bachelors degree in Winter 2022. My interests include AI/ML, Software Development, Robotics and Computer Architecture.

I have experience working as a Full-Stack Developer, a Teaching Assistant, and a Technical Writer.
