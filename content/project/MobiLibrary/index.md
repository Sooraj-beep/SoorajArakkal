## Project Description
MobiLibrary is a book lending/borrowing app built for a software design principles course over the span of 4 months. Me and 5 other members worked consistently to collaborate and build a completed and polished app from the ground up while practicing software development principles such as agile scrumming and collaborating seamlessly using GitHub. The app was written for Android using Java on Android Studio.

## Accomplishments
-	User login/registration and profile system.
-	Book marketplace and working search feature.
-	Working barcode scanner to easily add books into the database.
-	Utilized Google maps API to make borrowing/lending process effortless.
-	Aesthetically pleasing and easily navigable UI.


## Challenges
-	Developing the status page proved to be challenging due to unexpected bugs but I eventually figured out the best way to do it.
-	File management towards the end of the project was messy which led to slower work by the team.
-	Testing the app towards the end of development proved to be difficult but we combated this by utilizing automated testing APIs in Java.
